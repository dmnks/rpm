RPM-FILEATTR(7)

# NAME
*rpm-fileattr* - RPM file attribute system

# SYNOPSIS

# DESCRIPTION

File attributes are simple labels that RPM gives to files in the buildroot based
on a set of matching rules. These attributes are distinct from the standard file
metadata on disk and are only kept in memory during package builds. They can be
defined in a dedicated *rpm-macrofile*(5) or directly in an *rpm-spec*(5) file.
