STATIC TESTS
------------

This directory contains tests whose expected output needs to be "pinned" to a
certain commit.  Specifically, this includes tests that depend on the RPM
project and/or library versions, such as those that compare package digests or
RPM sonames against the expected values which change whenever those versions
are bumped.

The tests are used via the m4 macro RPMTEST_CHECK_STATIC([<name>]) where <name>
is the respective filename (without an extension) found in this directory.  The
macro then sources the script <name>.sh and compares its standard output with
the contents of <name>.txt.

To pin the *.txt files to the current commit, run "make static" from the build
directory.  This will run all the *.sh tests, capture their output and store it
in the corresponding *.txt files in your source directory, then automatically
git-stage the changes and print the diff (if any).
